dna rna functions
RNA splicing
exons - the coding regions on the genes
introns - the non coding regions in the genes with seperates the exon regions
the inro codes are removed from the transcripted mRNA sequence which are the non coding sequences that seperates the exons
mrna
transports the rna spliced rna string to the ribosome on top of Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
trna
contains the 3 anti codon nucleotide bases which are matched to the corresponding amino acids by a covalent bond
rrna
contains information about formation of ribosomes
contains essential proteins which helps in the catalytic activity for protein syntheisis
mrna terminals -> NCS non coding sequence
5' cap = 7-methyl guanosie triphosphate
3' cap = polyadenylate polymerase
anti codon -> the 3 complementary nucleotide bases which are matched to the correseponding amino acids in the trna
dna replication
replication begins at the oric
the helicase starts to unwind from the origin of replication,
which provides access to the single stranded regions of the dna to the dna polymerase
the dna is unwound into to strands -> leading strand 5' to 3', and lagging strand 3' to 5'
these strands act as template strands on top of which the replication takes place
dna polymerase requires a nucleic acid with a free 3' -OH bond which is provided by the primer sequence which helps initializing the dna replication process
the primer sequence is a non coding RNA sequence provided by the RNA primase enzymes
then the dna polymerase attaches the incoming 5' phosphate end of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate to the 3' -OH end resulting in the concomitant release of pyrophosphates
the replication can only take place in the 5' to 3' direction, since only the 3' ends contain the free 3' -OH bonds for the dna polymerase to attach, while the 5' ends contains the phosphate groups on which the dna polymerase cant attach
the function of dna polymerase is to ensure fidelity to dna syntheisis, repair damaged and mismatched nucleotides
it also has 2 additional exonuclease functions
5' - 3' exonuclease function is to remove the non coding sequence of the RNA primer sequence and provide correct nucleotides to attach
3' - 5' exonuclease function is to repair the mismatched nucleotides which happens rarely and the dna polymerase catches it immediately to fix the mismatched nucleotides
then another enzyme called ligase is used to fix any phosphodiester linkage breaks found in the sequence
telomerase is a enzyme which adds the ending sequence to the end of the sequence
on the lagging strand, the dna polymerase cant traverse in the 3'-5' direction
so multiple primase enzymes adds multiple primers ahead of the template strand to which the dna polymerase can attach and adds small small segments of sequences of the range 20-200 base pairs which are called okazaki fragments.
the dna polymerase's exonuclease again removes the RNA primer sequences and fixes the left of spaces and ligase bonds the phosphodiester linkages between the okazaki fragments
transcription
Initialization
the coded start sequences are abled to easily identified by the help of some sequences called promoters
and other sequences which provide catalytic enhancement to the proccess is called enhancers
these promoters and enhancer help in initializing the transcription process
unlike dna replication, which starts from 1 origin of replication, in RNA transcription the process concurrently happens at multiple start codons found in the dna strand
the transcription only happens in one strand called template strand unlike dna replication which uses both strands
the mRNA sequence is a complementary sequence of the template strand
and an identical match to the non template strand which is called the coding strand
elongation
during the start of the elongation process, the rna polymerase attaches to start codon which is (adenine uracil guanine)
it attaches to the free 3' -OH bond of the 7-methyl guanosine triphosphate and starts the transcription process
the incoming 5'-phosphate group that is the alpha phosphate groung of the ribonucleotide triphosphate is attached to the 3'-OH bond by a phosphodiester linkage and resulting in a concomitant release of pyrophospates
in the 3' opening of the RNA polymerase the dna strads are taken in as well as the incoming nucleotides
inside the RNA polymerase the dna is unwound and mrna strand is transcripted and removed continously
out of the 5' end of the RNA polymerase, the dna strands are rewound and coiled back and released and the mrna strand also comes out
termination
the nucleotide addition takes place until a stop termination sequence is reached in the template strands
with the help of enzyme called telomerase
following termination the RNA polymerase dissociates from the template strand

the mrna is not immediately sent to the site of translation but some preproccessing happens -> undergo significant posttranscriptional processing
called RNA splicing, which is The sequences encoded by the intronic DNA must be removed from the primary transcript prior to the RNAs being biologically active. The process of intron removal is called RNA splicing
translation
the rrna which contains robosomic proteins and information create robosomes which helps and catalyzes the protein syntheisis process
The initiator tRNA is not used for incorporation of methionine into noninitiation locations in the rest of a protein
The initiation of translation requires recognition of an (adenine-uracil-guanine) AUC codon
There are three termination codons: UAG, UAA, and UGA
